# M3rcury Email Service

The M3rcury project presents a solution for the [UberÂ© Email Service](https://github.com/uber/coding-challenge-tools/blob/master/coding_challenge.md) coding challenge. The challenge consists in design and develop a mail service that accepts the necessary information from the users and sends emails.
To provide service availability, the service uses internally two email services.

## Overview

M3rcury is a full stack application. The service is exposed through a RESTful API compliant with the standard Internet protocols HTTP and JSON. Users can also send requests filling a web form in the [live site](https://m3rcury.herokuapp.com).

The backend validates and dispatch the email received throught the RESTful API, keeps track of the status of every message processedn and retry in case of failures. [Mailgun](https://sendgrid.com) and [Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com) are the email service providers.
In order to increase response time and scalability, the application can be configured to use a task queue to distribute the load across the workers.

The front-end consists of two web pages, respectively to submit a new email, and get the links to explore the status information.

#### Installation/deployment
1. Checkout the git repository
```
git clone https://github.com/prisconapoli/mercury
```
2. Activate the virtual environment
```
cd mercury
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
3. Install requirements and database creation
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py createdb
```
4. Start Celery and Redis
```
run_redis.h
run_celery.h
```
5. Start the server
```
python manage.py runserver
```

To stop the service hit ```CTRL+C```

Exit the virtual environment
```
deactivate
```

To force the creation of a new database
```
python manage.py createdb --force
```

#### Usage
The fastest way is use the [live site](https://m3rcury.herokuapp.com). Fill the form and click on *send* button.

If everything is fine, you will be redirect through a new page that contains the links to see your request and the processing status:

</p>

#### Improvements
If I had more time, I wish to do the following improvements:

- **email**: add support for cc,bcc, html content, small attachment (e.g. up to 5 MB), jumbo mail (e.g. with dropbox or google drive integrtion)
- **real-time views**: track the mail status in real-time, monitor the average load of the system, arrival rate, average processing time
- **event-driven system**: replace SQLAlchemy and the task queue with a complete publish subscribe solution, e.g. kafka or kinesis
- **dynamic dispatching**: introduce different classes of requests (e.g.  text only message, with html, small or large attachment,  multiple recipients) and use separate workers for every class
- **retry policy**: define a strategy to reprocess or notify the sender the messages accepted by the system but not delivered due a failure of all the mail providers
- **plans**: define a strategy to analyze and eventually reprocess the messages accepted by the system but not delivered due a failure of all the mail providers


##### Things left out
I had no time to create web pages to track the progress of every request in real time. The idea is collect all the events related to a mail message, and show them along with time information and delivery status.

##### Service limitation
**Mailgun** requires a list of *Authorized Recipients*. All the emails to Unknown address will be discarded.
**Celery + Redis**: the task queue is disabled on Heroku. It was necessary update the plan. User can test it in the development environment running the scripts in two separate windows:
```
    ./run_resis.sh
    ./run_celery.sh
```



##Architecture

### Tech Stack
The application has been developed with Python and Flask. Flask is a largely adopted microframework to build web applications. It is well documented (tons of tutorials, book and videos onlines) and well integrated with a large number of extensions to support typical use cases, e.g. web forms, databases, working queue, caching, test automation. 
###### Front-end
- Flask-WTF + Bootstrap + Font Awesome for the web pages
- Flask-Cache for view and function caching

###### Back-end: 
- Flask Microframework
- SQLAlchemy (SQLite for development and testing, Postgres in production) to store mails and events
- Celery + Redis for asynchronous task queue and built-in persistence
- SendGrid + Mailgun as service providers

###### Testing and Automation:
- Flask-Script extension for automated tasks: database creation, start the service, profiling
- Test automation, coverage tests, reports

###### Deployment
- gunicorn as HTPP Server
- Heroku as public cloud environment
- 

M3rcury has been designed with the following goals:
- availability: accessible across Internet, no service interruptions
- scalability:  take advantage of additional computational/storage resources, parallel teams of developers
- reliablility: retry policy, graceful degradation
- devops friendly: easy to deploy and monitoring
- security: allows only secure connections

To achieve these results, the application have been designed using a mail model to represent the processing status of a message.

## Mail model
The process of send an email can be described as a series of events, where different part of the application are involved. Look at the image below:
